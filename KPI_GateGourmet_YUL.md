# KPI Framework — Gate Gourmet Plant at YUL (Montréal)

## 1) Business Context
- **Plant:** Gate Gourmet at YUL Airport (Montréal).
- **Group structure:** Gate Gourmet is part of gategroup.
- **Industry:** Airline food catering.
- **Operational reality:** Time-critical operations with strict food safety requirements and tight airline turnaround windows.

This KPI framework is designed so your local plant performance can be compared against other plants globally while still reflecting YUL-specific operating constraints.

## 2) KPI Design Principles
1. **Comparable globally:** Use common formulas and reporting definitions across plants.
2. **Actionable locally:** Each KPI has a clear owner and target cadence (daily/weekly/monthly).
3. **Balanced scorecard:** Cover safety, quality, delivery, cost, people, and sustainability.
4. **Leading + lagging indicators:** Include both prevention metrics and outcome metrics.

## 4) Suggested “Top 10” KPI Set for Executive Reviews
If you need a compact dashboard for leadership, start with these 10:
1. LTIFR
2. Food Safety Audit Pass Rate
3. CCP Compliance Rate
4. On-Time Flight Cart Delivery
5. Dispatch Accuracy
6. Meal Quality Complaint Rate
7. Labor Productivity
8. Food Cost per Meal
9. Waste Cost %
10. Equipment Uptime

## 5) KPI Governance Model
- **Daily tier meeting (15–20 min):** Review previous day misses (delivery, errors, food safety deviations).
- **Weekly operations review:** Trends, root causes, and countermeasures.
- **Monthly plant performance review:** Compare against targets and global benchmark plants.
- **Quarterly business review:** Recalibrate targets and resource plans.

## 6) Data Standards (Important for Multi-Plant Comparison)
To compare YUL with other plants, standardize the following:
- Meal unit definition (what counts as a “meal”).
- Time window for “on-time” delivery (e.g., ±5 minutes vs slot schedule).
- Complaint classification (quality vs service vs airline-driven change).
- Inclusion/exclusion rules for temporary labor, charter flights, and weather disruptions.
- Currency normalization for cost KPIs.

## 7) 90-Day Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2): Align Definitions
- Confirm KPI dictionary, formulas, and owners.
- Validate data source for each KPI (ERP, QA logs, dispatch system, HR/payroll, maintenance CMMS).

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3–6): Baseline & Pilot
- Build baseline using last 3–6 months of data.
- Pilot dashboard with Operations, QA, and Finance.
- Fix data gaps and automate extraction where possible.

### Phase 3 (Weeks 7–10): Target Setting
- Set threshold bands: **Red / Amber / Green**.
- Align targets to gategroup regional benchmarks.

### Phase 4 (Weeks 11–13): Full Rollout
- Launch governance cadence.
- Assign countermeasure playbooks for each KPI when out of tolerance.

## 8) Example KPI Target Bands (Template)
| KPI | Red | Amber | Green |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| On-Time Delivery | <98.5% | 98.5–99.4% | ≥99.5% |
| Dispatch Accuracy | <99.3% | 99.3–99.69% | ≥99.7% |
| Waste Cost % | >4.0% | 3.1–4.0% | ≤3.0% |
| LTIFR | >2.0 | 1.1–2.0 | ≤1.0 |

## 9) Quick Start Version (If You Need to Launch Immediately)
Start this month with just five KPIs:
1. On-Time Flight Cart Delivery
2. Dispatch Accuracy
3. Food Safety Audit Pass Rate
4. Labor Productivity
5. Waste Cost %

Then expand to full scorecard after 4–8 weeks.
